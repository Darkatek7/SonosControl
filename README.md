## Usage
### Docker Compose ([click here for more info](https://docs.linuxserver.io/general/docker-compose))

Create a file called docker-compose.yml.

Ubuntu/Debian:
```
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste following code:
```
---
version: '3.4'
services:
  sonos:
    container_name: sonos
    image: darkatek7/sonoscontrol:latest
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Vienna
    volumes:
      - ./Data:/app/Data
      # persist dataâ€‘protection keys
      - ./dpkeys:/root/.aspnet/DataProtection-Keys
```

Login using the default admin user:
```
admin
```

password:
```
ESPmtZ7&LW2z&xHF
```

The default user is seeded with both **admin** and **superadmin** roles. Only a superadmin can assign roles to other users, and superadmin accounts cannot be deleted by non-superadmin users.

### *This is optional. You only have to do this if you get a config.json error for some reason.*

At first create a folder called **Data**.

Ubuntu/Debian:
```
mkdir Data
```

Now create a file called **config.json**

Ubuntu/Debian:
```
nano Data/config.json
```
and paste the following:
```
{
  "Volume": 15,
  "StartTime": "06:45:00",
  "StopTime": "17:30:00",
  "IP_Adress": "10.0.0.1",
  "Stations": [
    {
      "Name": "Antenne Vorarlberg",
      "Url": "web.radio.antennevorarlberg.at/av-live/stream/mp3"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Radio V",
      "Url": "orf-live.ors-shoutcast.at/vbg-q2a"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Rock Antenne Bayern",
      "Url": "stream.rockantenne.bayern/80er-rock/stream/mp3"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Kronehit",
      "Url": "onair.krone.at/kronehit.mp3"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Ã–3",
      "Url": "orf-live.ors-shoutcast.at/oe3-q2a"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Radio Paloma",
      "Url": "www3.radiopaloma.de/RP-Hauptkanal.pls"
    },
    {
      "Name": "365 days christmas",
      "Url": "us3.streamingpulse.com/ssl/7038"
    },
    {
      "Name": "__BREAKZ.FM__ by rautemusik (rm.fm)",
      "Url": "breakz-high.rautemusik.fm/"
    }
  ],
  "SpotifyTracks": [
    {
      "Name": "Top 50 Global",
      "Url": "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXbMDoHDwVN2tF"
    },
    {
      "Name": "Astroworld",
      "Url": "https://open.spotify.com/album/41GuZcammIkupMPKH2OJ6I"
    }
  ]
}
```
You can change the config to fit your needs or change it later in the UI.
